# RBCbot-beta-0.1
This is my first public project.

This is RBCbot beta, a development stage of a chatbot I'm working on. RBCbot is a rule-based chatbot built in Python. It doesn't do much; it just introduces itself and takes the user's name. I'm pretty new to Python, so I will add more as time goes on. Like the project to see the project unfold before your eyes. (To use this project, make sure you have Python installed. If not, get it here for free: https://www.python.org/downloads/
